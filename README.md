# ðŸŽ¨ gitdrawer
A simple Bash script that helps you draw stuff in your contributions history diagram.

## Usage

It's pretty simple.

1. Figure out what you want to draw.
2. Find the exact dates that would successfully sketch your drawing into the contributions diagram.
3. Input those dates into the `DATES` variable in the `gitdraw.sh` script file.
4. Run the script: `./gitdraw.sh`.

## Example

I wanted to give a friendly reminder to all of my profile viewers - "Hey, <i>Keep Yourself Positive</i>". Unless it's for COVID. If it's for COVID, stay negative.

## Notes

If you're not sure about the local date format of your commits, just run `git log` and check it out.
